# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard (PH) is looking ahead to understand how many baby-boomers will be retiring soon, what departments they currently work in, and what positions they currently hold.  They need to understand the impact of these retirements and analyze if a mentoring program between the predicted retirees and the upcoming generation would be a good move in their succession planning strategy.

## Results
Below are the key numbers needed to evaluate the "silver tsunami":
1. There are 133,776 data points of baby-boomers born between between 1/1/1952 - 12/31/1955 and job titles. Some of these data points are considered duplicate because an employee could have had multiple titles during their career.

2. There are actually only 90,398 employees in the list after removing the duplicate lines and only reporting the last/current position held of each "baby-boomer" employee.

The number of mentorship eligible employees are in the following departments:

The retiring employees are in these departments:

![Retire_by_Dept2b.png](https://github.com/WagnerLisaK/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Retire_by_Dept2b.png)



It appears that the pool of mentorship eligible employees needs to be increased dramaticallty and that there are plenty of mentors to do the mentoring in each department.
